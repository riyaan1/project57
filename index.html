        <p> My favorite hobby is collecting and solving many different types of Rubik’s Cubes. I’ve been collecting and cubing for almost a 6 months now. My hardest puzzle that I am trying to solve right now is the skewb
            <br>
            The cubes I have learned to solve are the Pyraminx,2x2,4x4 and, of course, the 3x3. In the future, I hope that I will be able to obtain more Rubik’s Cubes for my collection and that I will be able to solve each and every one of them!
